<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Large-size very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery has emerged as a critical data source for high-precision vector mapping of
	multi-scale geographical elements such as building, water, road, and so forth. Benefiting from its strong and flexible data learning ability,
	the deep learning-driven vector mapping technique has become the current mainstream technology. When dealing with the large-size image,
	due to the limited memory of GPU, the deep learning-based vector mapping methods often employ the sliding block strategy.
	This inevitably leads to the degenerated performance because of the stitching difficulty of the sliding blocks' vector mapping results. Therefore,
	it is necessary to exploit the full-scope vector mapping technique to leverage large-size VHR remote sensing imagery. To this end,
	this paper presents a novel global context-aware local point optimization method, which can flexibly support the popular CNN and Transformer architectures,
	for vector mapping of geographical elements in large-size VHR remote sensing imagery. To leverage the global context in the large-size image,
	this paper proposes a novel pyramid fusion network (PFNet) to conduct semantic segmentation of the large-size image in an end-to-end manner. Under the constraint of the global semantic segmentation result,
	a new inflection-point perception network (IPNet) is proposed to generate a set of stable points to depict the boundary of each element. Extensive experiments on building, water and road datasets,
	where each image has over 100 million pixels, show that our method outperforms the existing vector mapping methods with a large margin.

<h2 id="PFNet">PFNet</h2>
<p>PFNet is meticulously designed for semantic segmentation of large-size VHR remote sensing imagery. Firstly, by employing a hierarchically organized representation of the large-size VHR image,
	PFNet can conduct a comprehensive analysis of information across different field-of-views. Subsequently,
	an Adaptive Fusion Architecture (AFA) is proposed to fuse information from different field-of-views.
	Finally, PFNet leverages a novel pyramid fusion loss to balance the contribution from different layers,
	ensuring robust semantic segmentation of geographical elements in large-size VHR remote sensing imagery.

<h2 id="IPNet">IPNet</h2>
<p> IPNet is specifically designed for refining the coarse contour of each instance in the semantic segmentation result
	by moving the coarse boundary points to inflection-points.
	Initially, we obtain coarse points by tracking boundary from the semantic segmentation result,
	and perturbations are added to coarse points to obtain the perturbed points,
	which is unnecessary during the inference stage.
	One point-to-point pair construction process is established by associating these perturbed points with their corresponding label points.
	Subsequently, 
	image patches centered on the perturbed points are fed into an effective Semantic-Guided Point Perception Architecture (SPA) to detect inflection-points,
	and a joint structure-semantic loss is applied to supervise this process.

<h2 id="VHR-road dataset">VHR-road dataset</h2>
<p> Until now,
	the existing road datasets for remote sensing imagery typically treat roads as linear targets,
	often neglecting the width attribute of the roads.
	At the same time, these datasets fail to fully cater to the characteristics of large-size VHR remote sensing images.
	To address this issue, we propose a groundbreaking dataset: VHR-road.
	The VHR-road dataset endows roads with the attribute of width.
	The dataset comprises 208 images,
	each sized at 12,500 x 12,500 pixels,
	with a spatial resolution of 0.200 meters.
	These images are poised to address the current challenges in complete road extraction from large-size VHR remote sensing images,
	providing researchers with a more comprehensive dataset to foster further exploration and development in this field.</p>

		<p>The VHR-road dataset was curated from the BDORTHO database of the French National Institute of Geographic and Forest Information (https://geoservices.ign.fr/bdortho).
			The imagery spans from approximately 2010 onwards, 
			with updates occurring every 3-4 years.
			The most recent images in the dataset are dated to the year 2022.
			It is worth noting that there exists temporal variability among the provinces.
			While some provinces exhibit a complete time series, others lack recent imagery updates.
			To align the dataset as closely as possible with the utilized foundational label data,
			the selected images for this dataset were predominantly collected in the years 2017, 2018, and 2019.
			This strategic selection ensures temporal consistency, enhancing compatibility with the associated baseline label data.</p>

	<div id="secondPage" class= "hide">
		<p>Prior to the commencement of data annotation,
			an initial step involved the extraction of all road categories from the Urban Atlas land cover classification labels (https://land.copernicus.eu/local/urban-atlas/urban-atlas-2018),
			serving as the foundational baseline for subsequent annotation efforts.
			The comprehensive annotation process encompassed three distinct stages.
			Firstly, a rigorous training program was conducted to equip annotators with the necessary skills and guidelines.
			Following the training phase,
			fine annotation was executed,
			wherein annotators meticulously marked road boundaries within the collected images using ArcGIS software.
			In cases where ambiguity arose,
			reference to Google Maps of the corresponding areas was made to facilitate the annotation process.
			The final stage involved a meticulous checking process conducted by domain experts.
			This phase aimed to validate the accuracy of the annotations,
			ensuring precision in boundary delineation,
			detecting and rectifying any potential redundancies or omissions.
			Moreover, each identified issue from the checking process was addressed to guarantee the overall quality and reliability of the annotated dataset,
			which sufficiently fulfills the necessities for the algorithmic evaluation.
